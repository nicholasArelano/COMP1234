I have just returned from Chamonix and I got multiple compliments, the clothing fits absolutely perfectly, kept me warm but ventilated, and was aero dynamic. I loved the over helmet hood which kept the back of my neck warm and prevented any snow / cold air going down my back. The goggles were brilliant, zero glare, zero fog, very comfortable and super visibility in all conditions Thank you!" Adam F. </li>
